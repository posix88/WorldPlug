# ⚠️ Before Starting

The project is generated on developer side using tuist.

Before starting please install all the tools needed to execute tuist.

- Download and install `Mise` using the instruction you can find [here](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#quickstart)
- Once installed launch `mise install tuist`
- Mise requires the activation of the tools, so run inside the project folder `mise use tuist@latest`

Now you are ready to launch `tuist generate`
